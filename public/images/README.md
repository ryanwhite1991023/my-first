## Current Placeholder Structure
The website is currently set up with placeholder images. Once you add your actual screenshots:
1. The placeholders will automatically be replaced with your images
2. Users can click on any screenshot to view it in a modal
3. Screenshots are displayed in a responsive grid layout
4. Hover effects and animations are included for better user experience

## Updating the Component
If you want to add more projects or change the image paths, edit the `src/components/Projects.js` file and update the `images` arrays in the project data.
